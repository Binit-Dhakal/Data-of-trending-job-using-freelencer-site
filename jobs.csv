Upgrade EQ-3 with arduino / tasmota,"your task will be to build a modification for the standard Eqiva EQ-3 bluetooth Door LockThe modification shall work on a arduino(here a instruction page: https://ingenier.wordpress.com/2018/02/17/eqiva-key-ble-eq-3-bluetooth-mit-wlan-nachruesten/ )So the new door lock will be usable via WIFI and via tasmota. (Also the old path via EQ-3 and BLE + the bottons/switches shall be workable as a last resort if the arduino fails to respond))your tasks:hardware- find in a shop a standard or 3d-print (resin) a case fitting on the left or right handside of the EQ-3- the case needs to have a storage for the batteries matching to EQ-3 (holding 3xAA 1.5V alcaline or NiMH)- you buy the hardware and you assemble it to one unit- the new case shall have a higher capacity battery as the current EQ-3! (either add more or replace with a better like LiPo)- suggest us the proper hardware- the modification of the eq-3 needs to be done in that manner that the difference is not to see if you look at the door (of course the width or height can change.- a hard (all data erased to defaults) and soft reset functionality via a button or similar hardware solution- wires need to be placed in such a way, that they are not or hardly visible- battery needs to be easy to replace or easy to replace to charge (no skrewing wished)- you provide us the sources of your orders- you provide us the 3d models if you use a printersoftware- door lock needs to have still all features...- unlock...- lock...- open+unlock- users still need to be unique to identify- trace the usage of the users into a rolling logfile- it is okay that arduino needs to be wifi connected as initial setup- wifi setup has to be idiot proof- deliver the software based on tasmota (or recommend similar) to make it OTA updateable- deliver a very small UI, so unexperienced users can login with their userid+password and lock+unlock the door- tasmote & UI shall be working behind https encryptionwhat is not needed?- voice commands. We will integrate them in a later phase of the project (not in this job)you cannot access the EQ-3?No issue, share us a corresponding profile cylinder door lock to the EQ-3 which you can obtain locally. We are fine also to redecide for a different device (but must be attachable to a profile cylinder lock with a manual opening option, so users can get out in a emergency and a defective lock/battery)paymentsfor hardware- if you need the hardware to buy, we will file the money as a milestone. On delivery to us, you get the milestone releasedshipping- after you have provided videos with the proves that it is working accordingly, we will file you a milestone for the shipping. So you get the money for the shipping itself after delivery (use insurance delivery, so nothing can get lost)for working progress- you create us a video where you share us the working environment.

Modular Pressure Sensor Matrix PCBA,"**GENERIC BIDS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED**Include in your proposal:-expected MCU to useThis is Part 1 in a large project, the successful Freelancer will be asked to join on multiple contracts if performance on Part 1 is to a good standard.Most of this project can be replicated through a circuit design diagram that we will provide to promising freelancer bids.This project is for the design of a MODULAR large pressure sensor matrix PCB and requires the freelancer to develop a working PCBA, test it and deliver to our office. The pressure matrix is arranged in a grid formation, where one layer has vertical lines and the bottom layer has horizontal lines. By scrolling through each line very quickly we can determine the exact pressure positions on the sensor mat. We have used multiplexers and , diodes and switches in the past to achieve this function and it worked really well so we suggest the freelancer to use a similar method. Voltage dividers also help give the matrix a wide sensing range..We have our own sensor mat prepared so the freelancer does not need to make the mat but should perform testing with off the shelf FSR to ensure the PCB works as desired.The PCB should also include circuitry for 6 DC vibration motor drivers which operate at 3V. The microcontroller used should have very fast processing speed to allow for quick scanning of the 1800+ sensor points. Arduino or similar programming language is preferred so we can make edits in future.Design Requirements:-A module for playing simple sounds (buzzer or similar)-MODULAR pressure sensor input so we can use the same PCB with different number of rows and columns of sensor lines. Vertical input (columns) up to 100 inputs and Horizontal input (rows) up to 100 inputs. But the pressure sensor circuit should work with any combination of columns and rows.-Analog reading of pressure sensor should be used, use of a voltage divider or similar circuit is recommended, diodes for circuit protection-Very fast based processor and MCU-6X vibration motor driver circuit to control 6 DC coin type motors operating at 3V-Lipo 3.7V or 7.4V battery power, also power through USB-C when connected-Fast recharging rate via micro-usb or USB-C-Wired and Wireless mode - BLE (wireless) or USB-C (wired to PC)-BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) for communicating sensor values to a PC or phone-USB-C to USB or data interface to plug PCB directly to a PC for reading the values (when BLE is not used)-Should include power button or ON/OFF switch to turn the PCB ON/OFF-RGB Led for status indication, i.e. Blue LED means ON, Green LED means charging battery, Red LED means low battery, Purple LED means ON and Connected (BLE).-Green Led to indicate charging-Basic speaker/buzzer model to create good quality sounds/chimes (think pokeball plus/ps4 controller)The freelancer is not expected to do much coding, only to test the circuit elements and features. The code is also to mainly ensure the pressure sensor matrix and power circuits are working correctly.THE FREELANCER MUST USE EAGLE COMPATIBLE FILESProject Deliverables:1) PCB Eagle Schematic Files, BRD files, Gerber Files, BOM, X-Y pick and place, Code2) Video of working PCB with testing3) PCBA delivered to our office",$181 -$544,"['Electronics', 'Microcontroller', 'Electrical Engineering', 'PCB Layout', 'Circuit Design']"

Media server and player similar to plex except instead of local storage it uses cloud storage.,"I would like a web app that will act as a media server  and apps for mobile/TV for media viewer. Similar to Plex/Jellyfin/Emby.The Media Server part will have different sources of obtaining media from the cloud such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Mega.nz, Box.net etc. The user will create a company-name account on our website, then will need to log in to their cloud accounts to link them with their company-website account.There should be a web interface as well with admin portal. The admin portal will allow me to edit the amount of days until membership expiration on a per user basis as well as show the users current plan ie: how many people to share with.After linking different cloud accounts and signing in with their company-name account, the user can create different libraries within the app such as movies, tv shows, home videos, music, etc. For each library they can add any folder path from any cloud they have synced/linked to their company-name account. They can always edit this to change which cloud folders are connected to the specific libraries.If a new library is identified as type ""movies"" then all items from each of the cloud folders in that library will be added and will neatly display each movie with a movie poster, movie name, movie release date. If there are multiple copies of the same movie that should be represented by a little number icon in the bottom of the movie poster. When they click/tap to play the movie, they will be prompted which version they wish to watch by showing the file name.extension, file size, and which cloud service it came from(Google Drive, Dropbox, Mega.nz etc.) The Media server will scan the file names in the cloud folders. Usually in format ""movie name (2019) - xxxxxx.xxxxx-xxx.mkv""TV Series will be very similar to the Movies section except there is an extra layer, after tapping/clicking on the tv series poster they will be able to choose a specific season of the series, then it will list out episodes for the user to choose. The Media server will scan the file names in the cloud folders. Usually inside a folder with TV series name followed by date then inside the folder it will be tv series name followed by S01E01 for season 1 episode 1.If the plan the user chose permits, the user can choose to add other users to their ""server"" by adding their username and can assign them access to either a certain library/libraries or access to all of their libraries.A free user account will only be able to be added to one other persons server.I'd like there to be an option in the settings to choose either the internal video player or external video player such as VLC or MX PLayer.When any person plays the media file no matter if its the person that owns the account or if the server is being shared with someone else, the media will always come directly from the cloud straight to the client device and will always direct play with no transcoding.**There should also be a referral system in place. People will have incentive to invite other people.has capability to remember where someone left off on a movie/video/tv - resume functionality.cloud services to offer - Google drive, Gsuite, Dropbox, Dropbox for business, one drive, one drive for business, mega.nz, FTP server, HTTP server, vidoza.net, Amazon S3, Box, pCloud, Flickr, Gooogle Photos, NAS, Mediafire, Put.io, sugarsync, Backblaze, WebDav, Owncloud, Yandex, Baidu, 1fichier, uptobox, Streamz.to, dudestream, mixdrop, onlystream.tv, streamtape.com, cloudvideo.tv,function to search your libraries and the shared friend libraries.There will be a way to track what media has already been watched.",$250 -$750,"['Website Design', 'Mobile App Development', 'Software Architecture', 'Google APIs', 'Cloud Service']"

Customize Project Management Software - 11/11/20,"** READ THE ENTIRE BRIEF. WE DELETE BIDS THAT DON'T FOLLOW DIRECTIONS **We need someone that can customize the Teameyo software for our needs:https://codecanyon.net/item/teameyo-project-management-system/23142804The project will be broken up into several tasks and milestones to ensure adequate progress is being made in a timely manner. Daily updates (every 24 hours) showing progress are mandatory.FREELANCER REQUIREMENTS:- Be able to FOLLOW DIRECTIONS- COMMUNICATE OFTEN about the status of your work, with SPECIFIC DETAILS- complete the 3 things listed in this brief- (1st thing) In your response, include the word ""BYETRUMP"" at the top to let us know you have read through this listing completely. If you do not, you will be blocked from communicating on any of our postings for lack of attention to detail.- You need to be available to chat about the details of the project, preferably near the time you bid on it. We move FAST so we need someone who is available and ready to work immediately. If you cannot chat when you bid, do not bid- You'll need your own testing environment to work on the software. We can supply the software AFTER your bid is accepted, but you need your own server to install and test. We will NOT provide a testing environment.PROJECT DETAILS:To give a bird's eye view of the project, we need several things to be completed:- convert this existing project management system to one that allows customers to submit their own projects and tasks (which are later uneditable except by Staff or Admin)- build a 4-page form where users can enter detailsThis is not a super large project, but rather one that could be completed by competent developers or teams who do a little bit each day for a few days. The first few tasks will be short, one-day assignments meant to test your competence and skill level, and then we can implement longer milestones afterwards.We are not newbies; we expect competence at all times; if we have to explain simple things to you, you will be eliminated very quickly. Also, please don't do the chit chat thing where you post messages that say ""Hi"" and ""How are you"" as it wastes time and you need to talk specifically about the project and how you can help us.(2nd thing) Please supply RELEVANT experience. DO NOT just show websites that you installed themes for, we need to know:- what site you worked on- specifically what you implemented for the client- a before and after snapshot would be great to seeFinally (3rd thing), in your own words, be able to tell us what we want to accomplish in this project.Ask any questions that you may have.

Bash Scripting (.sh),"I have two labs to be completed:FIRST LABNote: The usage doesn't have to be related to the script's original purpose.i) Single quote 'ii) Double quote ""iii) Backslash \iv) Back quote `v) $(..)vi) expr3) Bank script. No if statements and/or loops allowed for this question.part i) Write a shell script called deposit.shThis program should take two arguments. The first argument is a filename, and the second argument is a deposit amount. The 'file' should already exist on the machine and contain a number indicating a user's balance amount in their bank account. The script should then increase the account balance by the deposit amount, and save the result to the same file.Here is an example of how the deposit.sh script will modify a file with a given deposit amount. This example assumes the filename 'alex_balance.txt' already exists on the system.$ cat alex_balance.txt50$ ./deposit.sh alex_balance.txt 100$ cat alex_balance.txt150part ii) Write a shell script called debit.shThis program should take two arguments. A filename that points to the account balance, and a number that indicates the debit amount. The script should reduce the account balance by the debit amount, and save the result.part iii) Write a shell script called show_balance.shThis program should take one argument. This argument should be a filename that points to the account balance to be displayed to the user.part iv) Perform the following transactions in a single script called, oct_trans.sh. Assume the balance equals zero to start. You can use any filename of your choice for this question as long as the value stored in the file is initialized to zero.deposit <filename> 1200debit <filename> 390debit <filename> 29debit <filename> 8deposit <filename> 120debit <filename> 50debit <filename> 40debit <filename> 20debit <filename> 9deposit <filename> 1200debit <filename> 200debit <filename> 9debit <filename> 50deposit <filename> 1200debit <filename> 129debit <filename> 80debit <filename> 9debit <filename> 20display account balance.What is the remaining balance?SECOND LAB1) Using loops, modify your ./debit and ./deposit scripts to be able to take more than two amounts for your deposit/debit transaction.For ex../deposit.sh alex 200 1000#this should run the deposit script commands for a $200 deposit first, followed by a $1000 deposit second.2) Write a script that will continuously withdraw 20 of dollars from an account until the balance is depleted (or the remainder is less than 20 dollars). Once completed, echo back to the user how many 20 dollar bills they have received. You must use arguments to specify the account file",$8 -$23,"['Python', 'Bash Scripting']"

Also, you do *not* need an ESP32.If you are very intelligent and also solve problems scientifically then I will pay you to learn C/C++ on Arduino or MicroPython on ESP32.  You will help me build a consumer IoT (Internet of Things) product. You must live in one of my 1st, 2nd, or 3rd choice countries to apply. In other words, please do *not* apply unless you live in one of my 1st, 2nd, or 3rd choice countries.✻ MY FIRST CHOICE COUNTRIES ✻Bosnia and HerzegovinaBrazilBulgariaSerbia✻ MY SECOND CHOICE COUNTRIES ✻AlbaniaCroatiaKosovoMexicoMontenegroNorth Macedonia✻ MY THIRD CHOICE COUNTRIES ✻ArgentinaChileColombiaCosta RicaEcuadorMoldovaPanamaTurkeyUruguayVenezuela✻ HOW TO APPLY ✻If you would like me to invite you to bid on this project, please paste...Arduino_or_ESP32_11_Nov_2020into your Freelancer profile so that when I search for...Arduino_or_ESP32_11_Nov_2020I will find your profile and probably invite you to bid on this project.If I were to invite you, you would be able to bid on this project ""for free"" (without spending one of your bids). Please wait *patiently* for up to 48 hours for me to invite you because I do *not* have a bot, rather I would need to manually invite you to bid.✻ PAYING YOU TO LEARN ✻No. You aren't dreaming.I would rather work with an inexperienced person who is very intelligent and solves problems scientifically than an experienced person who is neither very intelligent nor solves problems scientifically.✻ I WILL PAY YOU DAILY FOR ONE HOUR OF YOUR TIME ✻Hourly pay is generally beneficial to you because most freelancers underestimate the time required to complete fixed-price projects. I suggest you search on Google for ""Reddit Fixed-Price vs. Hourly Software Development"" to educate yourself.✻ HOURLY RATE ✻I estimate that you will normally work 1 hour/day for 10 US dollars/hour. But, I presume Freelancer will pay you 9 US dollars/hour after they deduct their 10% fee.You will normally work 20 days each month for 9 US dollars/hour.✻ YOU DO NOT NEED A MICROCONTROLLER ✻You do *not* need to have a microcontroller because I will have an Arduino or ESP32 here in Los Angeles. You will teach me in real-time by *text* chatting with me for one hour per day for five days each week. I will program the Arduino or ESP32 as we text chat (*not* video chat).✻ TEXT CHAT ✻You and I will text chat (*not* video chat) for one hour on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday during a time that is convenient for you and me.✻ WHY ARDUINO OR ESP32? ✻I would prefer that you complete this project using MicroPython on ESP32. But, I've had difficulty finding someone who is interested in using MicroPython on ESP32. Therefore, I'm willing to have you work on this project using C/C++ on Arduino.✻ C/C++ ON ARDUINO OR MICROPYTHON ON ESP32? ✻Please either respond by pasting, ""I prefer to C/C++ on Arduino"" or ""I prefer to use MicroPython on ESP32.""Don't worry. I will accept either response. Primarily, I want to figure out which is more popular among candidates. I think MicroPython on ESP32 is better for this project yet I suppose many candidates have used C/C++ or Arduino and therefore would prefer C/C++ on Arduino.✻ DESIRABLE BUT NOT REQUIRED ✻Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, C#, .NET, microcontroller, IoT, electrical engineering, circuit design (PCB design), mechatronics, and/or electronics.",$9 -$10,"['Java', 'JavaScript', 'Python', 'Microcontroller', 'C++ Programming']"
